## üìù A. Analyzing Customer Churn in Power BI
### I. Case Study Description
For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI case study, you'll investigate a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn‚Äôt just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it‚Äôs also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. You'll answer these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.

## üìù B. HR Analytics in Power BI
### I. Case Study Description
In this Power BI case study, you will be exploring a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This course focuses on helping you import, analyze and visualize Human Resources data in Power BI. Building on your existing knowledge of the platform, you'll learn how to effectively work with Power BI using example data.
